title: Linux from scratch
description: "For quite some time i've wanted to create a Linux from scratch build. 
Sure, Kiwi and other auto-build tools are nice, but doing it the hard way is always more fun. 
I wasn't eager to just copy/paste stuff from the book while knowing eventually i'd had to do it again. 
So creating a custom build script while doing it seemed a good idea. Check it out."

# Unfinished post - Not Finishedo

## LFS?
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides people with step-by-step instructions for building a customized Linux system entirely from source.
  
I'm following book version 7.6, which [can be found here](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/read.html).
  
Also, all the code i've written is [on github](https://github.com/robinradic/lfsbuild)
